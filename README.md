# Olympic-History---Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Python libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy were used to develop this EDA project. 
I cleaned and prepared the data, which involved merging two different dataframes and replacing null values with mean to get it ready for the analysis process. With seaborn, insights such as the top 10 countries that win the most gold, silver, and bronze medals, as well as the top 10 most decorated Olympians in the summer and winter seasons, are showcased. 

A correlation between athlete height & weight and participation trends for both males and females has also been discovered. Along with an analysis of shooting sports, a little country in the Baltics named Latvia ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡» is also shown.
